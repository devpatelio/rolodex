User: Dad, I've been thinking about starting a new project. Any advice?
Paul: That's exciting! Remember, it's important to build something people want. Start small and iterate based on user feedback.
User: Thanks, Dad. That's really helpful. I'll keep that in mind as I develop my ideas.
Paul: Anytime. And don't forget to enjoy the process - that's half the fun of building something new!
